        <h2>TREEINSECT</h2>
        <p>Hello and welcome to the <b>website</b> of <b>Will Wright</b>!</p>
        <p>This page is currently under construction, so for the time being, here are some of my past projects, WIPs, and things I'm involved in!</p>
        
        <h4>WIPs</h4>
        <p><b>Personal Website -</b> Get to know me through a <b>raw HTML5 mystery game</b>, complete with graphics <b>modeled and textured by me.</b></p>
        <p><b>Culkulator -</b>A short form which calculates what percentage of Rory Culkin's filmography you've seen. I'm at <b>80%!</b></p>

        <p><b>Five Nights in A32 -</b> A FNAF 1 remake made in <b>Pygame,</b> set in the University of Nottingham's Jubilee Campus. Made for <b>Royal Hackaway.</b></p>

        <h4>Side Stuff</h4>
        <p><b>Mentor Scheme -</b> I volunteered for and was chosen as a 2nd Year Mentor on the University of Nottingham Computer Science course. This involves running/participating in <b>course events</b>, <b>answering questions</b> from the year below, and providing a point of contact for a <b>group of 15 mentees.</b> It's a lot of fun!</p>
        <p><b>Brothers Cream Productions - </b>An unofficial and unincorporated production company, working on making silly films for fun. Currently in preproduction on <b>Lenton Chainsaw Massacre.</b></p>
